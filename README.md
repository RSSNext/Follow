## ü§ù Contributing

If you are eligible to use Follow, you are welcome to join the open source community to build together.

Before you start, make sure you have enabled [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Corepack makes sure you are using the correct version (`packageManager` field in `package.json`) for package manager when you run corresponding commands.

```sh
corepack enable
```

Install dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Develop in the browser

```sh
pnpm run dev:web
```

Then the browser opens `https://app.follow.is/__debug_proxy`Ôºåyou can access the online API environment to development and debugging.

### Develop in the electron

You need to fill in the required environment variables first.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://api.follow.is` and run:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Since it is not very convenient to develop in Electron, the first way to develop and contribute is recommended at this stage.

> [!TIP]
> If you can't log in to the app, copy the `authjs.session-token` in the cookie from your browser into the app.
