## Releases

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1243823539426033696?logo=discord&label=Discord&style=flat-square&color=5865F2)](https://discord.gg/followapp) [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/any_text-Follow-blue?color=2CA5E0&label=_&logo=x&cacheSeconds=3600&style=flat-square)](https://x.com/intent/follow?screen_name=follow_app_)

Currently, Follow is still in the early developer preview stage (alpha) and is only available to a limited number of users through an invitation system.

You can get an invitation code in the following ways:

- Looking for any alpha test user to invite you.
- Join our Discord server for occasional giveaways.
- Follow our X account for occasional giveaways.

If you have access, you are welcome to use the following methods to download and install it:

- Visit our online webapp at [app.follow.is](https://app.follow.is)
- You can get the installation packages for each platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/RSSNext/Follow/releases).
- If you are using Arch Linux, you can install package [follow-appimage](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/follow-appimage) that maintained by [timochan](https://github.com/ttimochan).
- If you are using Nix, you can install package [follow](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/by-name/fo/follow/package.nix) that maintained by [iosmanthus](https://github.com/iosmanthus).
- If you are using macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), you can install package [follow](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/follow) or [follow@nightly](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/follow@nightly) that maintained by [realSunyz](https://github.com/realSunyz).

## Contributing

If you are eligible to use Follow, you are welcome to join the open source community to build together.

Before you start, make sure you have enabled [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Corepack makes sure you are using the correct version (`packageManager` field in `package.json`) for package manager when you run corresponding commands.

```sh
corepack enable
```

Install dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Develop in the browser

```sh
pnpm run dev:web
```

Then the browser opens `https://app.follow.is/__debug_proxy`，you can access the online API environment to development and debugging.

### Develop in the electron

You need to fill in the required environment variables first.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then set `VITE_API_URL` to `https://api.follow.is` and run:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

Since it is not very convenient to develop in Electron, the first way to develop and contribute is recommended at this stage.

> [!TIP]
> If you can't log in to the app, copy the `authjs.session-token` in the cookie from your browser into the app.
