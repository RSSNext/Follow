# Follow Command Abstractions

this module encapsulates the command abstractions specifically designed for the Follow feature, which is leveraged through CMD-K.

The architectural design of the API takes inspiration from the [VSCode Command Abstractions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.commands).

The registry component has been adapted from the innovative work found in [AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/blob/de81527e294ee99865ae7218fa4d22ad0660bf34/packages/frontend/core/src/commands/registry/README.md).

Furthermore, the hook design principles draw inspiration from the ideas proposed by [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/27044).
