# What's new in v0.1.2

## Features

- Custom CSS is now supported, so you can add any CSS style and apply it to the Entry content view.
- New Zen mode has been added, so you can now read the full text in full screen without interruption, and we've optimized the user experience of the ToC component in full screen mode as well as added a new brief timeline on the left side.
- Support for hiding extra badges around the feed, such as Claim or Boost, which you may not want to see.

## Improvements

- Fixed the issue that Entry list cannot be loaded offline.
- Optimized the performance experience of some scenarios.
- The UI of some components has been fine-tuned to look more natural.
